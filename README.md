# A fictional accountant office website.

    I built this webpage, in order to get more familiar DOM manipulation,

css, responsive web-design, basic concepts of React and React-routing.

    It took me a while to built it, due to other obligations in my life,

but now it is complete. I didn't add any server side code, so the contact
form is not functional like in my portfolio page. But the point of this
project was only to get a deeper understanding in the concepts mentioned
above.
